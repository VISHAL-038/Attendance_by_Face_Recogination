# Attendance by Face Recognition

This project is a face recognition-based attendance system that uses Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, and various other libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Datetime, and OS for different functionalities. It enables adding faces to the database, taking attendance based on face recognition, and showing live attendance through a web interface built using Streamlit.
